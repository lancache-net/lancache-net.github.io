## Simple Full Stack startup

To initialise a full caching setup with dns and sni proxy you can use the following script as a starting point:
```
export HOST_IP=`hostname -I | cut -d' ' -f1`
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name lancache-dns --detach -p 53:53/udp -e USE_GENERIC_CACHE=true -e LANCACHE_IP=$HOST_IP lancachenet/lancache-dns:latest
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name lancache --detach -v /cache/data:/data/cache -v /cache/logs:/data/logs -p 80:80  lancachenet/monolithic:latest
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name sniproxy --detach -p 443:443 lancachenet/sniproxy:latest
echo Please configure your router/dhcp server to serve dns as $HOST_IP
```
Please check that `hostname -I` returns the correct IP before running this snippet

## Changing from lancachenet/steamcache and lancachenet/generic

This new container is designed to replace an array of steamcache or generic containers with a single monolithic instance. However if you currently run a steamcache or generic setup then there a few things to note.

1) Your existing cache files are NOT compatible with lancachenet/monolithic, unfortunately your cache will need repriming
2) You do not need multiple containers, a single monolithic container will cache ALL cdns without collision
3) lancachenet/monolithic should be compatible with your existing container's env vars so you can use the same run command you currently use, just change to lancachenet/monolithic

## Origin and SSL

Some publishers, including Origin, use the same hostnames we're replacing for HTTPS content as well as HTTP content. We can't cache HTTPS traffic, so if you're intercepting DNS, you will need to run an SNI Proxy container on port 443 to forward on any HTTPS traffic.

```
docker run \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --name sniproxy \
  -p 443:443 \
  lancachenet/sniproxy:latest
```

Please read the [lancachenet/sniproxy](https://github.com/lancachenet/sniproxy) project for more information.


## DNS Entries

You can find a list of domains you will want to use for each service over on [uklans/cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains). The aim is for this to be a definitive list of all domains you might want to cache.

## Suggested Hardware

Regular commodity hardware (a single 2TB WD Black on an HP Microserver) can achieve peak throughputs of ~30MB/s using this setup (depending on the specific content being served).  This would be suitable for very small LANs (<10 people).  For any sort of hosting for LAN sizes above this, it is thoroughly recommended that your storage backend is entirely SSD or NVMe.

## Advice to Publishers

If you're a games publisher and you'd like LAN parties, gaming centers and other places to be able to easily cache your game updates, we reccomend the following:

 - If your content downloads are on HTTPS, you can do what Riot have done - try and resolve a specific hostname. If it resolves to a RFC1918 private address, switch your downloads to use HTTP instead.
 - Try to use hostnames specific for your HTTP download traffic.
 - Tell us the hostnames that you're using for your game traffic. We're maintaining a list at [uklans/cache-domains](https://github.com/uklans/cache-domains) and we'll accept pull requests!
 - Have your client verify the files and ensure the file they've downloaded matches the file they **should** have downloaded. This cache server acts as a man-in-the-middle so it would be good to ensure the files are correct.

 If you need any further advice, please contact us and we'll be glad to help!
 
 ## How to help out
To build just run `docker build --tag lancachenet/monolithic:testing .`. To test you can run `./run_tests.sh`

If you want to test a new build with a forked uklans repo you can specify a combination of `-e CACHE_DOMAINS_REPO="https://github.com/vibroaxe/cache-domains.git" -e CACHE_DOMAINS_BRANCH="testing"` or even `-v <your repo here>:/data/cachedomains -e NOFETCH=true` if using a locally bind mounted git repo.

# Hardware examples and throughput 

## Introduction

This project is heavily reliant on the hardware that you run it on.  The most 
common complaint is "The cache is slow" and in nearly every case this can be 
attributed to the hardware that the cache is being run on.


The following hardware specifications are real-world examples of hardware that
has been used to run this project, so you can get an idea of the type of 
performance that you can expect from varying hardware setups.



## High Capacity

24 CPU core, 140GB memory, 8 x Samsung 850 Pro SSD in RAID6
Served ~2,800 uniques, peaking at 10Gbps


## Medium capacity

24 CPU core, 180GB memory, 5 x 900GB 15K SAS drives, plus 180GB SSD (lvmcache)
Served ~250 uniques, peaking at 1.8Gbps

## Low capacity

CPU: Quad-core AMD Phenom X4 II 945 (old!)
MEM: 16GB DDR3
Disk: 2x2TB RAID0 + 512MB SSD LVM Cache.
Without the LVM Cache the system will push around 300-400mb/s, with the SSD Cache pushing around 800-900mb/s



### Disabling `systemd-resolved` DNSStubListener
If your cache host is running a recent Linux distribution, it is likely running `systemd-resolved`, which listens on port `53`. If you want your cache host to bind to `0.0.0.0:53` (INADDR_ANY, all IPv4 addresses), you will first need to disable `systemd-resolved`'s stub listener.

1. Run `sudo -e /etc/systemd/resolved.conf` and change the line starting with `#DNSStubListener=` to `DNSStubListener=no` - _removing the `#` is important_
1. Run `sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf`
1. Run `sudo ln -s /var/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf`
1. Run `sudo service systemd-resolved restart`
1. Check that you can still resolve DNS on the cache server by running `nslookup` for a domain of your choice (e.g. `lancache.net`)
